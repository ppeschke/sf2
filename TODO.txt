ToDo: (+ means done)(- means not done)(/ means WIP)

Bug Fixes:
- Fix flickering (of particle effects, cursorTarget, and directionIndicators)
- fix collisions now that things move based on deltaTime
+ Fix particle effect rendering (slant at edges of screen)
- Figure out why explosions are just fuzz sound
Efficiency Issues:
+ Make arena into a mesh object so that it doesn't have to load into VRam every frame
+ Fix "Vec2D Get3DScreenEdges()" (direct3D.cpp) so that it is more efficient
- tighten up the ParticleEffect logic so that they don't run so many particles if time is short
/ Get everything to update based on deltaTime
Sound:
- Get some good sounds
- Get some good music
Graphics:
- Finish creating meshes
Gameplay:
- Add class specializations for different ships
Network & Multiplayer:
- Impliment Client/Server... heh
